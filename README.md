GitWriter is the easiest way to version control your thoughts. Write in Markdown, auto save every minute like Google Docs. Easy.

## ‚≠ê Usage

Login with GitHub, choose your repo and file, and just start writing.

The service is frontend-only and only uses local storage for your token. Since GitHub's OAuth endpoints don't support CORS, it also uses [Cors Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/).

## üõ† Development

Start development server with:

```bash
yarn serve
```

### XSS vulnerability

Because GitWriter uses simplemde, it's open to XSS: [CVE-2018-19057](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19057). Since you're writing Markdown which compiles to HTML, you can add JavaScript on things like the `img` tag's `onerror` attribute. However, GitHub strips any JavaScript from Markdown files, so it will only be executed on the GitWriter site, not on GitHub.

### Todo
- [x] Autosaving
- [x] Add support for saving every 2 minutes if it's dirty (interval, not just on text change)
- [ ] Before unloading the page, make sure it's saved
- [ ] Use `localStorage` for every change, so you don't lose anything
- [x] Better auto-commit message
- [x] Add login with GitHub (integrate GitHub App, not personal token)
- [x] Show all repos, support filter/search
